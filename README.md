# Notice board

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

#### `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

> Note: `create-react-app` is deprecated, thus, the need for `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.
I decided to leave this as is as it does not break the functionality. In real live scenario, `create-react-app` would not be used.

## Running the dev environment

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
